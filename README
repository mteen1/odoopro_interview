# SIMD-like Operations in Python

I tried to simulate 16-bit SIMD operations for addition and subtraction in Python. It's designed for exploring concepts, not performance.

## Features
- Simulates 16-bit addition and subtraction.(not real SIMD, simd in python could be like this [python-swar](https://www.da.vidbuchanan.co.uk/blog/python-swar.html))
- Includes basic tests to ensure functionality.

## Usage
Use `add_16bit_simd` and `subtract_16bit_simd` for 16-bit operations. Run `test_simd_operations` to test.

I hope you find it useful!
